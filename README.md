# Rental-contracts-audit

After I had finnished the Python Fundamental and Advances courses at BitAcad, I decided to but my knowledge into action. 
In the normal manner, I used spending up to 20 days for manual checks at Avis Romania while I was working as an internal auditor.
After the script has been made, I was able to finish the same checks in just 12 second in high season, followed by 2-3 days of manual checks.

The second script was created from the desire of automatizing the errors reporting on email, which was also a repetitive task.
